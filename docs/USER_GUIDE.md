# 🌟 AI Yield Optimizer - User Guide

*Making DeFi Simple, Smart, and Profitable*

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### 💰 **About Money & Returns**

**Q: How much money do I need to start?**
A: You can start with as little as $1 USDC, but we recommend at least $100 to see meaningful returns and cover transaction fees effectively.

**Q: When can I withdraw my money?**
A: Anytime! There are no lock-up periods. Withdrawals typically process within minutes.

**Q: Are the returns guaranteed?**
A: No, returns fluctuate based on market conditions. While our AI optimizes for the best available rates, cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile.

**Q: How often does the AI rebalance my portfolio?**
A: The AI monitors opportunities continuously and rebalances when it finds significantly better returns (usually when improvements exceed gas costs).

### 🔒 **About Security**

**Q: Is my money safe?**
A: We use multiple security layers including audited smart contracts, emergency pause functions, and insurance protocols. However, DeFi always carries some risk.

**Q: Who has access to my funds?**
A: Only you have access through your wallet. Our smart contracts are non-custodial, meaning we never hold your funds directly.

**Q: What if the AI makes a bad decision?**
A: The AI includes safety mechanisms and confidence thresholds. You can also manually override any AI recommendations.

### 🤖 **About the AI**

**Q: How smart is the AI?**
A: Our AI uses Amazon Bedrock with advanced language models trained on financial data. It continuously learns from market conditions and performance outcomes.

**Q: Can I turn off the AI and manage manually?**
A: Yes! You have full control and can disable automatic rebalancing while still using our platform for manual DeFi access.

**Q: How transparent is the AI's decision-making?**
A: Very transparent. The AI provides explanations for all recommendations including expected returns, risk assessments, and confidence levels.

### 🌐 **About Technology**

**Q: Which blockchains do you support?**
A: Currently Ethereum and Avalanche, with Polygon and Arbitrum coming soon.

**Q: Do I need to understand blockchain technology?**
A: Not at all! Our interface is designed for anyone to use, regardless of technical knowledge.

**Q: What wallets are supported?**
A: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and any WalletConnect-compatible wallet.

### 💸 **About Fees**

**Q: What fees do you charge?**
A: We charge a small performance fee (typically 10-20% of profits) only when you make money. No monthly fees or hidden charges.

**Q: What about gas fees?**
A: Gas fees are network transaction costs that go to blockchain validators, not us. Our AI optimizes to minimize these costs.

**Q: Are there any withdrawal fees?**
A: No withdrawal fees from our platform, though you'll pay standard blockchain gas fees for the transaction.
